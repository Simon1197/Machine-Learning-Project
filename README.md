# Machine-Learning-Project

•	Create a model with apporpriate explanatory variable and use machine learning methods to tune the model.
•	Impact- expect > 80% of stability and accuracy in multiple machine learning prediction models.
•	Manipulate the data by cleaning, merging, and selecting relational variables via R.
•	Check the diagnostic, assumption, and transform the data via the EDA of each machine learning method.
•	Use ten-fold validation to tune the data and compare the results of Logistic, LASSO, Ridge, LDA, and Tree regression (random forest, decision tree).
